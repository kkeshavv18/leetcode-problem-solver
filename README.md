A Chrome extension that automatically generates solutions for LeetCode problems using the Google Gemini API.

## Features

- ü§ñ Generates JavaScript solutions using Google's Gemini AI
- üìã One-click copy of generated solutions
- ‚öôÔ∏è Simple API key configuration
- üîí Secure storage of your API key

## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store

_(Coming Soon)_

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository or download as ZIP

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-problem-solver.git
```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory

5. The extension icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar

## Setup

1. Get your Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

2. Click on the extension icon and then click on the gear icon, or right-click the extension icon and select "Options"

3. Enter your API key in the field and click "Save"

## Usage

1. Navigate to any LeetCode problem page (e.g., https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

2. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup

3. Click "Generate Solution"

4. Wait a few seconds for the solution to be generated

5. Click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the solution

6. Paste the solution into the LeetCode editor

## How It Works

The extension works through the following process:

1. **Content Script**: When you're on a LeetCode problem page, a content script extracts the problem description from the page's metadata.

2. **Background Service**: The background script sends the problem description to the Google Gemini API, which generates a JavaScript solution.

3. **Popup Interface**: The popup script displays the solution and provides a button to copy it to your clipboard.
